<!--PROJECT DESCRIPTION-->

## About the Project

<!-- header image of project -->

![Project Header][project-header]

### Project Description

Nebulog is a location-based reflection platform that transforms inner thoughts and feelings into a digital cosmos of shared experiences. Built as a React Native mobile application with Expo, it allows users to launch their reflections into the universe, creating a constellation of thoughts that can be discovered by others through an interactive map. Centred around the theme of space, Nebulog aims to encourage users to build the habit of self-reflection, with daily streak-tracking and a unique space-themed style and aesthetic.

### Project Inspiration & Constraints

This project was developed based on three key inspiration cards that shaped the entire concept and implementation:

**Goal Card: Build a Habit**

- The core objective was to create an application that encourages users to develop a daily habit
- Implemented through the streak tracking system that motivates users to reflect daily

**Interaction Card: Geolocation**

- The primary interaction method revolves around location-based features
- Users can discover reflections from others in their vicinity through the interactive map
- Location services enable place-based reflection sharing and discovery

**Constraint Card: No Traditional UI Buttons**

- Traditional button elements were completely avoided throughout the interface
- Replaced with gesture-based interactions, swipe controls, and hold-to-activate mechanisms

## Nebulog Screens

### Authentication Screens

**Onboarding** (`/`)

![Onboarding Screen](./docs/onboarding-screen.png)

The Onboarding screen introduces users to Nebulog's core concepts through an interactive carousel. It features three key sections: "Launch Your Thoughts" explaining the reflection system, "Connect Through Location" describing the map-based discovery, and "Customise & Build A Habit" highlighting profile customisation and streak tracking. The background features star-sky-like animations and space-themed imagery to set the cosmic tone and create a good first impression for users.

**Login & Signup** (`/(auth)/login` & `/(auth)/signup`)

![Auth Screens](./docs/auth-screens.png)

Both the Login & Signup screens feature real-time validation (including username uniqueness, email format and password checking). Both screens utilise Firebase Authentication for secure email-based login, with automatic session persistence that allows returning users to bypass the login process and go straight to the home screen.

### Core App Screens

**Home** (`/(app)/home`)

![Home Screen](./docs/home-screen.png)

The Home screen serves as the heart of the Nebulog app, featuring an interactive map where users can discover public reflections from others. It displays the user's current streak, total reflections, and provides quick access to launch new thoughts. Users can simply tap on a reflection to read it, and if they like it, they can hold the reflection to "echo" / like it, which will store it to their echoed reflections list on their profile screen. Furthermore, users can also tap anywhere on the map to create a reflection based on the selected location.

**Thought Launch** (`/(app)/thoughtlaunch`)

![Thought Launch Screen](./docs/thought-launch-screen.png)

The Thought Launch screen is where users create and share their reflections. It features a mood selector with space-themed categories, text input with a character limit display (300 character limit), location selection, and privacy controls. After filling out the form, users hold down on the bottom button until a shaking animation plays, and upon release, will create the reflection, and show the user on the home screen's map.

**Location Search** (`/(app)/locationsearch`)

![Location Search Screen](./docs/location-search-screen.png)

Part of the thought launch process - a dedicated location selection interface that allows users to search for specific places or use their current location. It integrates with Google Places API for real place suggestions (both street addresses and businesses), and is optimised to use 'biased search', which prioritises place results located near the user.

### Profile Screens

**My Profile** (`/(app)/myprofile`)

![My Profile Screen](./docs/my-profile-screen.png)

The My Profile screen displays the user's personal information, reflection history, and statistics. It includes tabs for personal reflections, echoed reflections from others, and blocked users management. Users can edit their profile, view their streak progress, manage their own reflections (either edit or delete posts), 'un-echo' reflections they echoed, and manage their list of blocked users.

**User Profile** (`/(app)/userprofile/:id`)

![User Profile Screen](./docs/user-profile-screen.png)

Similar to the My Profile screen, the User Profile screen displays the info of a user that is not the logged in user. It also shows their profile info and statistics, but only their public reflections. On this screen, users can view others' content, and block users if needed. Once a user is blocked, that user will no longer see any reflections created by the blocked user (both on the map or in their echoed reflections list).

**Edit Profile** (`/(app)/editprofile`)

![Edit Profile Screen](./docs/edit-profile-screen.png)

On the Edit Profile screen, users can update their username, bio, profile icon, and profile colour. It includes the custom colour picker and icon selection system, with real-time previews of changes.

**Profile Colour Pick** (`/(app)/profilecolourpick`)

![Profile Colour Pick Screen](./docs/profile-colour-pick-screen.png)

A dedicated colour selection screen featuring a custom colour wheel picker. Users can select from predefined colour palettes or create custom colours for their profile, with immediate preview of how the colour will look on their avatar. This screen also utilises a custom hex-color-to-names library, which converts the selected hex colour name to an English name.

**Profile Icon Select** (`/(app)/profileiconselect`)

![Profile Icon Select Screen](./docs/profile-icon-select-screen.png)

An icon selection interface displaying all available space-themed profile icons (and some non-space related for variety). Users can browse through icons like space objects, animals, nature, and objects to find the perfect representation of their identity, without needing to upload profile pictures. This design choice reflects Nebulog's philosophy of focusing on inner thoughts and reflections rather than external appearances, creating a more inclusive and content-focused social experience.

<!-- CONCEPT PROCESS -->

## Concept Process

### Ideation

<br>

![Ideation][ideation-pic]

Nebulog was conceived as a unique approach to digital journaling and social connection, directly inspired by the three project cards. Today, many people struggle with:

- Healthy expression of inner thoughts
- Feeling emotionally understood
- Being present in the moment
- Building habits of inner emotional awareness

Nebulog aims to address these issues by offering an anonymous space to reflect and connect with others - all tied to real places and gentle habit-forming mechanics.

**Key Design Principles**

- **Cosmic Aesthetic**: Space theme to make reflection feel like an adventure / an exploration of the inner "universe"
- **Location-Based Discovery**: Connecting people through shared spaces and experiences (Geolocation Card)
- **Mood Expression**: Visual representation of emotions through space objects
- **Habit Formation**: Streak tracking to encourage daily reflection (Build a Habit Card)
- **Gesture-Based Interaction**: Innovative controls without traditional buttons (No Traditional UI Buttons Card)

### Wireframes

<!-- DEVELOPMENT PROCESS -->

## Development Process

The `Development Process` is the technical implementations and functionality done in the frontend and backend of the application.

### Implementation Process

**Architecture Decisions**

- **React Native + Expo**: Chosen for cross-platform mobile development and rapid prototyping
- **TypeScript**: Implemented for type safety and better developer experience
- **Firebase**: Selected for backend services due to real-time capabilities and scalability
- **GlueStack UI NativeWind**: Utilised for consistent styling and rapid UI development

**Key Technical Implementations**

- **Real-time Database**: Firestore integration with live listeners (for post like/unlike updates)
- **Location Services**: GPS integration with Google Maps and Places API
- **Authentication System**: Secure user management with Firebase Auth
- **Geospatial Queries**: Location-based content discovery using Geofire (cannot rely solely on latitude & longitude)
- **Custom Animations**: Lottie integration for engaging user experience

#### Highlights

**Interactive Map**

- Google Maps integration with custom styling and custom markers, efficient geospatial queries using Geofire, and real-time location-based reflection discovery based on user location or selected places.

**Mood Stylisation**

- Moods are visually represented with space-themed icons and custom colour schemes, creating an engaging and interesting emotional means of expression.

**Custom Buttons & Animations**

- Custom swiping and hold-to-activate buttons were implemented throughout the interface, providing unique interaction patterns that replace traditional UI elements.

#### Challenges

**Maps Integration**

- Tricky map implementation challenges including unexpected bugs, inconsistent animations, and unpredictable behaviour that required extensive and frequent debugging.

**Cross-Platform Compatibility**

- Maintaining consistent UI behaviour across iOS and Android
- Android-specific issues with z-index layering and content visibility, particularly affecting the custom gesture-based buttons

**Custom Button Implementation**

- Gesture detection reliability issues and app stability challenges when implementing custom interaction patterns, requiring careful testing and different approaches to implementation.

### Future Implementation

**Enhanced Social Features**

- Comment system for reflections to enable deeper discussions and community engagement
- User following and friend connections to build meaningful relationships

**Map Features**

- Sorting and filtering of reflections by mood, author, date, and location
- Emotional heatmaps and hotspots to visualise mood patterns across different areas

**Notifications & Engagement**

- Push notifications for reflection interactions (likes, comments, new followers)
- Streak reminders and motivational notifications to encourage daily reflection
